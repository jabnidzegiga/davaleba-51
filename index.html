    <h3 class="h2">about</h3>
    <p class="h3">Ego has no place in the design process. Fail quickly to succeed quickly. <br>
      Negative feedback is a gift. Universal design is ethical design. <br>
      Designers are toolmakers. <br>
      Meet people where they are. Be a facilitator. <br>
      Define the problem. Play. There's always more than one solution. <br>
      Empathy is the key to resonance. You are not your user.</p>
